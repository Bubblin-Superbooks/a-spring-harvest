Then did sleep\nBathe him in soothing waters, soft and deep,\nAnd left him whole, at breaking of the light,\nSo he beheld the old man, and desired\nThat he would tell of whom he was, and whence.\nWhereat once more the ancient eyes were fired:\n“I, I was Arthur’s bishop, at his court\nAnd in his church I ministered, and thence\nWhen at the last the whole was overthrown\nWith wrath and ill designings, straight I sought\nA place where I might die, too feeble grown\nTo endure a new beginning to my years\nWhen once the past was lost, and whelmed in tears.\nHither I came, where, in the dawns of time\nDim peoples, that the very stones forget,\nLived, loved, and fought, and wove the riddling rime\nOn a lake island mystically set.\nThey passed, and after ages manifold\nCame wandering sainted Joseph (even he\nThat tended God’s frail body, and enrolled\nIn linen clothes of spicèd fragrancy).\nHe brought the vessel, vanished now from earth\nThat wrought destruction to the Table Round,\nSince many deemed themselves above their worth\nAnd sought in vain, and perished ere they found.”\nThen Bedivere: “Alas the King! I saw\nThe unstayed overwhelming tide of war:\nAnd when the opposèd standards were unfurled\nOf Arthur and of Mordred, his base son,\nEre yet the noise of battle was begun\nI heard the heralds crying to the world:\n“‘Ye that have sought out pallid harmonies\nWhere never wind blows, save the gentle south:\nYe that have trafficked on the sounding seas\nAnd fear nor cheerless rains, nor scorching drouth:\n“‘Ye that have piled the rich, full-ripened crops\nOf word and measure, till the rime, grown proud,\nDid straight contemn the leaping mountain tops\nAnd lose itself in air, and riven cloud:\n“‘Ye that have lived a dangerous life of war\nWhose speech has been bold words and heady boasts\nGather, for strife and death unknown before,\nCome gather all unto the fronting hosts.’\n“I saw the last dim battle in the mist\nThere, where a dreary waste of barren sand\nDoth mark the ultimate leagues of this fair land;\nScarce we beheld the foe we struck, or wist\nWhich party had advantage: like thin wraiths\nFit to throng Lethe banks the warriors\nStruck and o’ercame, or fell, unseen, unwept;\nAnd alien hopes, lives, peoples, alien faiths\nWere all confounded on those desolate shores.\nAnd ever the mist seethed, and the waves kept\nA hollow chanting, as they mourned the end\nOf all mankind, and of created time.\nHow many fell therein of foe or friend\nI know not, save that when the darkness came\nAnd the mist cleared, I found at last the King,\nHis armour and visage fouled with blood and slime,\nAnd fading in his eyes the ancient flame.\n“I saw him make on Mordred with his spear,\nAnd crying ‘Tide me death, betide me life,\nHe shall not live, that wrought the accursed thing,’\nPut a dread ending to the outworn strife.\nI saw them fall together, and, drawn near.\nKnew that the King was wounded unto death.\n“Then as he drew with growing pain his breath\nI looked, and saw a long, black barge that stole\nAcross the waters, like a wandering soul\nReturnèd from the woeful realm, to view\nThe ancient haunts well-loved that once it knew.\nAnd when it touched the shallows I did bear\nThe dying Arthur as he bade, and there\nI placed him ’mid dark forms: I could not tell\nWhose they might be; and wept, and breathed farewell.”\nThen spake the eremite: “Beyond yon door\nThere stands a chapel, ancient and weatherworn,\nAnd there did worship in the days of yore\nThe sons of kings. The night ere you came hither\nI was awakened by the sound of feet.\nAnd I looked forth, and saw a body borne\nBy veilèd figures straight, as they knew whither,\nIn at the chapel gateway. I went down\nAnd found that they had digged a grave, most meet\nFor one of saintly life, or king by birth:\nThey seemed some score, and by blown candles’ light\nI saw that each with tears bedewed his gown\nEre sank the corse into the waiting earth,\nThen prayed, and so went out into the night.”\nThereon the twain arose, and went straightway\nToward the old, dim chapel, and beheld\nThe stone beneath whose length the body lay:\nKneeling they closely scanned it all, and spelled\nGraven in golden character, “Arcturus\nRex Quondamque Futurus.”\n###### Quoth Bedivere:\n“Thank God this voice remaineth unto us;\nNow I do mind me of a prophecy\nSpoken long since in some emblazoned year,\nHow Arthur should escape mortality\nAnd lie beneath the hills, in cavern deep\nOr on some shore, where faery seas do break:\nAround him all his warriors shall sleep,\nWho at a great bell’s sounding shall awake\nWhat time th’ old enemy spreads death and harm\nThorough his ancient realm, and the last woes\nGo over her; his own victorious arm\nShall rid the stricken land of hate and foes.”\nSo leave we them, each head inaureoled\nWith the awakening spring’s young sunlight-gold.\nThen, on an evening, hurrying footsteps rung\nWithout the door, and straight ’twas open flung,\nThey saw who stood therein, and each one knew\nThe face unspared by years and strife and shame,\nPale as the moon is pale on winter nights,\nWith deep eyes dreaming like September haze,\nOr lit with lust of battle, eyes that few\nHad looked on and forgot; in such wise came\nLancelot, the hero of immortal fights,\nLancelot, the golden knight of golden days.\n“Whence cam’st thou, Lancelot?” “Even from the Queen,\nThe Queen that was, whom now a convent’s shade\nImprisons, and a dark and tristful veil\nEnwraps those brows, that in old days were seen\nMost puissant proud of all that ever made\nThe traitor honest, and the valorous frail.\n“Yet evermore about her form there clings\nAnd evermore shall cling, the ancient grace,\nLike evening sunlight lingering on the mere:\nAnd till the end of all created things\nThere shall be some one found, shall strive to trace\nThe immortal loveliness of Guinevere.\n“Shall I not mind me of old ecstasies\nIn Camelot, beneath the ancient walls,\nIn shady paths, and marble terraces\nRose-fragrant, where eternal sunlight falls.\nBut ah! the last long kiss is ta’en and given,\nAnd the last look in those unfathomed eyes,\nThe passionate last embrace is coldly riven,\nAnd all is grief, beneath the pitiless skies.\n“Gods of the burnt-out hearth, the wandered wind,\nGods of pale dawns that vanished long ago,\nGods of the barren tree, the withered leaf.\nThe faded flower, and the ungarnered sheaf,\nGods half-forgot in the wild ages’ flow\nYours, yours am I, that all for nought have sinned.”\nSpring, summer passed away, and autumn rain\nSwelled the lean brooks, until the gelid year\nShot forth its icy hand, and grasped again.\nAgain the hanging clouds were struck and furled\nBy winds of winter, until skies were clear,\nAnd there was frost o’ nights, and all the world\nLay glistening to the newly risen sun.\nTill came that season, wherein solemn days\nDo celebrate the reign on earth begun\nOf the most blessèd Child, whenas all ways\nWere bound, and all the fields were white with snow.\nThen in the chapel at high noon they three\nOffered their quiet orisons and so\nCame forth and looked upon the purity,\nAnd when he saw the fields all stainless-white\nLancelot groaned in spirit, and spake: “How sore\nAnd no wise joyous to a sinner’s sight\nIs this dear land, where the snow lies untrod.\nEven so once before the eyes of God\nMy soul lay all unspotted; now no more.”\n“Courage, my son, and patience,” quoth the sage;\nNo sin there is, that shall not lose its stain\nThrough the great love of God, and His dear Son.\nRepent and be forgiven: know that none\nShall sue before His throne, and sue in vain,\nNor shall one name be blotted from the page\nIf he that bears it turn to prayer and tears.”\nThen Lancelot: “Though through the tale of years\nThat still are left before the longed-for earth\nReceive my body, I should strive amain\nTo slay myself, and gain regenerate birth,\nAlas it were all profitless and vain.\nVerily, when I came unto this place\nI railed on God, that I had lost my soul\nAnd nothing gained: until a heavenly grace\nEnwrapped me, like some sick man made half whole,\nAnd now my grief is only for old sin.\nBut ah, what boots it? Lo, this barren tree\n(He touched a shrub that grew beside the door),\nThis tree, methinks, shall bud and blossom before\nI pass the gates divine, and enter in\nTo the fair country I must never see.”\nBut even as he spoke, the hand of God\nWorked on the sombre branches, and straightway\nThey were all green with sap, and bud, and leaf,\nAs at the very bidding of the spring,\nBurst forth, and soon each tender branch was gay\nWith flowers that nodded in the winter’s breeze\n(So blossomed in old time the prophet’s rod),\nAnd Lancelot stood and saw the wondrous thing.\nThen softly spake the hermit, “Now is grief\nReproved, and sorrow cast out with the lees;\nFor God beholds the living, not the dead;\nAnd He that took the semblance of a child\nLoves He but penance, and the drooping head,\nHas He not sung for joy, has He not smiled?”\nSo they grew old together, and the years\nPressed no more to their lips the cup of tears\n(They had drained all, maybe). And ever less\nSeemed all things mortal, as in quietness\nThey pondered the eternal mysteries\n(The noblest heritage of all men born),\nSuch as are writ upon the face of dawn,\nOr in the glamour of a moonlit night,\nOr in the autumn swallow’s southern flight,\nOr in the breaking of the restless seas:\nOr dreamed rich, hallowed dreams of aureate days\nWhile yet the King was young, and sunlight fell\nOn bower and roof of ancient Camelot:\nOf triumph clarion, and thanksgiving bell,\nWhen all was song, and laughter, and high praise,\nEven when as yet the accursed thing was not.\nThen would loom out from the chill mists of time\nThe faces and the forms remembered still,\nThe King and Guinevere, and Galahad,\nThat rode upon a peerless quest and dire,\nKay, swift and hasty as a flame of fire,\nAnd gentle Percival, whom to give made glad;\nMerlin, contriver of the riddling rime,\nAnd Gawain, silent harbinger of ill.\nSo as the day draws ever toward the dark,\nEver toward peace the great wind’s sounding breath,\nAnd ever toward the further shore the bark\nThey drew to the dark, silent realm of death.\nFar, far away from their old palace-halls\nWhere once they lived a splendid life and vain,\nThat now are scattered stones and crumbled walls\nIn some soft vale, or by the echoing main,\nBeneath the springing grass, and very deep\nThey three do lie, where never mornings rise\nTo ope the portals of their dazèd eyes,\nNor ever mortal footstep breaks their sleep,\nAnd near beside lies Arthur, even he\nThat was King once, and yet again shall be."
