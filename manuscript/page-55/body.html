<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">But riches I can find enow
    All in a barren land,
Where sombre lakes shine wondrously
    With rocks on either hand:
And I can find enow of love
    Up there, alone, alone,
With none beside me save the wind,
    Nor speech except his moan.
For there far up among the hills
    The great storms come and go
In a most proud processional
    Of cloud and rain and snow:
There light and darkness only are
    A changing benison
Of the old gods who wrought the world
    And shaped the moon and sun.</pre></div> </div>
