<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>To The Cultured</h3><pre class="  ">Sons of culture, God-given,
First offspring of Heaven,
Athletic and tanned,
Well-built and not nervous,
With your golf and your tweeds
And your “noble editions,”
Quiet lives and few needs
(Say a thousand a year
For your earthly career)
Who can’t understand
Discontent and seditions,
May Heaven preserve us
From being like you.
What are we, what am I?
Poor rough creatures, whose life
Is “depressing” and “grey,”
