<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The woodland strown,
The silver mere,
The dying year,
And me alone.
Skies overcast!
Leaves falling fast!
Does she that passed
Dream of the woodland strown,
The woodland strown,
The silver mere,
The dying year,
And me alone?</pre></div> </div>
