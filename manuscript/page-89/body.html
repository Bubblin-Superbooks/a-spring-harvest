<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Memories</h3><pre class="  ">Shapes in the mist, it is long since I saw you,
    Pale hands and faces, and quiet eyes,
Crowned with a garland the dead years wrought you
    Out of remembrance that never dies:
One among you is tall and supple
    Good to fight or to love beside,
Only the stain of a deadly quarrel,
    Only that and the years divide:
One there is with a face as honest,
    Heart as true, as the open sea,
One who never betrayed a comradeâ€”
    Death stands now betwixt him and me.
One I loved with a passionate longing
    Born of worship and fierce despair,
Dreamed that Heaven were only happy
    If at length I should find him there.
