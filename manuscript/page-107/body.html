His feet were set towards the hills
Because he knew that there the rills
Ran down like jewels, and fairy cars
Galloped, maybe, among the dells,
And airy sprites wove fitful spells
Of gossamer and cold moonshine

And ever the hills called, and a voice
Cried: “Soon, maybe, comes thy choice

Such as shall never be again,
’Twixt the most passionate-pleasant pain
And all the quiet, barren joys
That old men prate about to boys.”</pre><hr class="section"><pre class="  ">He wandered many nights and days—
