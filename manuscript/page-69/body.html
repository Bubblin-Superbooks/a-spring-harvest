Now arm an uneventful rime
    With panoply of flowers
    Through the long summer hours...
But now our fierce and warlike Muse
Doth soft companionship refuse,
    And we must mount and ride
    Upon a steed untried...
We who have led by gradual ways
Our placid life to sterner days
    And for old quiet things
    Have set the strife of kings,
