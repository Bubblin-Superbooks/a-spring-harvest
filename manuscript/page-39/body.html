<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Pure Virginia</h3><pre class="  ">York River Returns
Like smoke that vanishes on the morning breeze
    Are passed the first beginnings of the world,
    When time was even as a bud still curled,
And scarce the limit set of lands and seas;
Like smoke, like smoke the composite auguries
    Of Hebrew and of Hellene are all furled,
    Fulfilled or else forgot, and idly hurled
This way or that way, as the great winds please:
Aye, and like smoke of this delicious herb
    Brought by strange ways the curious mind may guess,
        From where the parrot and the leopard be,
My thoughts, that should be strong, the years to curb
    Go up, and vanish into nothingness
        On a blue cloud of exquisite fragrancy.</pre></div> </div>
