<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Eremite</h3><pre class="  ">When the world is still in the hush of dawn,
And yet fast sleeping are hate and scorn,
From my grey lodging under the hill
I do go out, and wander at will.
Of nights when the riven clouds are hurled,
And strife and rancour possess the world,
I sit alone, with thoughts that are chill,
In my grey lodging under the hill.</pre></div> </div>
