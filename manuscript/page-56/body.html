<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>A Study</h3><pre class="  ">In chamber hung with white,
Lit by the dawning light,
Upon a slender bed
She lies, as she were dead:
Most carven-ivory fair,
And palely gold her hair.
Lo, the sun’s yellow ray,
That, with the rise of day,
Through quartered casement came
To wake her life’s pale flame.</pre></div> </div>
