<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Ave Atque Vale</h3><pre class="  ">In Oxford, evermore the same
    Unto the uttermost verge of time,
Though grave-dust choke the sons of men,
    And silence wait upon the rime,
At evening now the skies set forth
    Last glories of the dying year:
The wind gives chase to relict leaves:
    And we, we may not linger here.
A little while, and we are gone:
    God knows if it be ours to see
Again the earliest hoar-frost white
    On the long lawns of Trinity.
In Merton, of the many courts
    And doorways good to wander through,
Gable and spire shall glitter white
    Or tawny gold against the blue:
