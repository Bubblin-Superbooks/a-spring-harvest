<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Who battled have with bloody hands
Through evil times in barren lands,
    To whom the voice of guns
    Speaks and no longer stuns,
Calm, though with death encompassèd,
That watch the hours go overhead
    Knowing too well we must
    With all men come to dust...
Crave of our masters’ clemency
Silence a little space that we
    Upon their ear may force
    Tales of our trodden course.</pre></div> </div>
