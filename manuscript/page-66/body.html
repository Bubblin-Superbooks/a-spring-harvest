<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Might I but grasp at a bridle, and fear not to be trodden
    under,
Swing myself into a saddle, and ride on greatly, exulting
On down the long straight road of the wind, a galloping
    thunder!
    Only a grey sea, and a long grey shore,
    And the grey heavens brooding over them,
    Twilight of hopes and purposes forgot,
    Twilight of ceaseless eld, for when was youth?
    Is it not lonely here, beyond the years?</pre></div> </div>
