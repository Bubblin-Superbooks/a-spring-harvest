<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Old Kings</h3><pre class="  ">Far away from sunny rills,
Far away from golden broom,
Far away from any town
Whither merchants travel down—
In a hollow of the hills
In impenetrable gloom
Sit the old forgotten kings
Unto whom no poet sings,
Unto whom none makes bequest,
Unto whom no kingdoms rest,——
Only wayward shreds of dreams,
And the sound of ancient streams,
And the shock of ancient strife
On the further shore of life.
When our days are done, shall we
Enter their pale company?</pre></div> </div>
