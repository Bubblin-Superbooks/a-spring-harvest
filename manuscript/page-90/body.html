<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Shapes in the mist, ye see me lonely,
    Lonely and sad in the dim firelight:
How far now to the last of all battles?
    (Listen, the guns are loud to-night!)
Whatever comes, I will strike once surely,
    Once because of an ancient tryst,
Once for love of your dear dead faces
    Ere I come unto you, Shapes in the mist.</pre></div> </div>
