    Wearily, greyly the long years flow,
Almost the gloom has of hope bereft us,
    Far is the high gods’ song and low:
Sombre the crests of the mountains lonely,
    Leafless, wind-ridden, moan the trees:
Down in the valleys is twilight only,
    Twilight over the mourning seas:
Time was when earth was always golden,
    Time was when skies were always clear:
Spirits and souls of the heroes olden,
    Faint are cries from the darkness, hear!
Tear ye the veil of time asunder
    Tear the veil, ’tis the gods’ command,
</pre></div> </div>
