The sunlight which they soon should see no more.
And there came from the wood upon the hill
One clothed in the sere habit of a monk,
That passed in at the portal of the abbey:
Brighter his face than is the face of spring,
And joy was in his tread, as in his soul.
And some that paced the cloister paused to glance at him,
And one that went upon an errand stayed,
And some that laboured left their work, and came
Gathering round him, and he spake, and said:</pre><pre class="  ">â€œVery fair the golden morning
        As in yonder wood I strayed,
    And I heard diviner music
        Than the greatest harpers made,
    For a sweet bird sang before me
        Songs of laughter, and of tears.
