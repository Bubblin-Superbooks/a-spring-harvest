    And crossèd seven streams:
All in his hands were thyme and grass
    And in his eyes were dreams:
He passèd by a seven fields
    With early dews all grey
And entered in the stricken town
    About the break of day.
“O you old men that stand and talk
    About the market-place,
There is much trouble in your eyes
    And anguish in your face:
O woman in a silent room
    Within a silent house,
There is no pleasure in your voice
    Or peace upon your brows.”
