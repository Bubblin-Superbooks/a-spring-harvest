<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Creator Spiritus</h3><pre class="  ">The wind that scatters dying leaves
    And whirls them from the autumn tree
Is grateful to the ship that cleaves
    With stately prow the scurrying sea.
Heedless about the world we play
    Like children in a garden close:
A postern bars the outward way
    And whatâ€™s beyond it no man knows:
For careless days, a life at will,
    A little laughter, and some tears,
These are sufficiency to fill
    The early, vain, untroubled years,
Till at the last the wind upheaves
    His unimagined strength, and we
Are scattered far, like autumn leaves,
    Or proudly sail, like ships at sea.</pre></div> </div>
