<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">The great uncompromising page,
Are these but glittering baubles, flung
    About the world from age to age?
But ruin’d columns, wondrous tall,
    Built in old time with labour sore,
The mighty deeds done once for all,
    The voice heard once, and heard no more?
Rather they shine as doth the star
    About the close of winter’s day,
That cheers the traveller afar
    And draws him on, and points the way.</pre><hr class="section"><pre>We praise, we praise the immortal dead.
    Do they not verily wait till we
Of the spoilt years unharvested
    Be also of their company?</pre></div> </div>
