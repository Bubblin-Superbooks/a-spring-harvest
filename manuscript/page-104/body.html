    Bears down the latest of the godlike seed.
Many a singer lies on distant isle
    Beneath the canopy of changing sky:
Around them waves innumerable smile,
    And o’er their head the restless seabirds cry:
But we will lay him far from sound of seas,
    Far from the jutting crags’ unhopeful gloom,
Where there blows never wind save summer breeze,
    And where the growing rose may clasp his tomb.
And thither in the splendid nights of spring,
    When stars in legions over heaven are flung,
Shall come the ancient gods, all wondering
    Why he sings not that had so richly sung:
There Heracles with peaceful foot shall press
    The springing herbage, and Hephæstus strong,
Hera and Aphrodite’s loveliness,
    And the great giver of the choric song.
