<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>The Last Verses</h4><pre class="  ">O ageless nonpareil of stars
    That shinest through a mist of cloud,
O light beyond the prison bars
    Remote, unwavering, and proud;
Fortunate star and happy light,
Ye benison the gloom of night.
All hail, unfailing eye and hand,
    All hail, all hail, unsilenced voice,
That makest dead men understand,
    The very dead in graves rejoice:
Whose utterance, writ in ancient books,
Shall always live, for him that looks.
Many as leaves from autumn trees
    The years shall flutter from on high,
And with their multiple decease
    The souls of men shall fall and die,
</pre></div> </div>
