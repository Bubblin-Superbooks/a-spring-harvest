    From unknown lands beyond the hoary wave,
Shall travellers through every coming age
    Approach to pluck a blossom from his grave:
Some in the flush of youth, or in the prime,
    Whose life is still as heap√®d gold to spend,
And some who have drunk deep of grief and time,
    And who yet linger half-afraid the end.</pre></div> </div>
