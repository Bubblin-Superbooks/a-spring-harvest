    Are rich with pearls and gold
And silks and bales of cramasy
    And spices manifold:
Gardens they have with marble stairs
    And streams than life more fair,
With roses set and lavender
    That do enchant the air.
O there be many ships that sail
    The sea-ways wide and blue,
And there be master-mariners
    To sail them straight and true:
And there be many women fair
    Who watch out anxiously,
And are enamoured of the day
    Their dear ones come from sea:
