<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Awakening</h3><pre class="  ">Gold-crested towers against the veil√®d skies,
Sere branches of the winter trees beneath,
And a low song, and heavy-lidded eyes;
Is there aught else in all the world beside?
Is not time stilled and ended in this hour?

Up, and away! the belted squadrons ride!</pre></div> </div>
