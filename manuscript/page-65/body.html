<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Wind Over The Sea</h3><pre class="  ">Only a grey sea, and a long grey shore,
    And the grey heavens brooding over them.
    Twilight of hopes and purposes forgot,
    Twilight of ceaseless eld, and when was youth?
    Is it not lonely here, beyond the years?
Out of the gathering darkness crashes a wind from the
    ocean,
Rushing with league-long paces over the plain of the
    waters,
Driving the clouds and the breakers before it in sudden
    commotion.
Who are these on the wind, riders and riderless horses?
Riders the great ones that have been and are, and those
    to come shall be:
These are the children of might, life’s champions and
    history’s forces.
