<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Such as shall split the mountain-tops
    And shrivel up blue heaven:
That there be men who mock at threats
    And wag their heads at strife,
Love home above their own hearts’ blood
    And honour more than life.”</pre></div> </div>
