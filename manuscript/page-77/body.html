    At noonday, or at sunset hour
On Magdalen, girt with ancient trees,
    Beneath her bright immortal tower.
Though nevermore we tread the ways
    That our returning feet have known
Past Oriel, and Christ Church gate
    Unto those dearer walls, our own.
Oxford is evermore the same,
    Unto the uttermost verge of time,
Though grave-dust choke the sons of men,
    And silence wait upon the rime.</pre></div> </div>
