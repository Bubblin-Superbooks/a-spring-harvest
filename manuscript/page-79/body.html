    Who weep that others die,
Who quake, and curse ourselves, and watch
    The vengeful hours go by?
O better far to fly the grief
    That wounds, and never kills;
O better far to fly the town
    And seek the seven hills——”
“I will go pray the seven gods
    Who keep the seven hills
That they do grant your city peace,
    And easement of her ills.”
“Nay, rather pray the seven gods
    To launch the latest pain;
For there be many things to do
    Ere we see peace again.”
“Then I’ll go praise the seven gods
    With hymns and chauntings seven,
