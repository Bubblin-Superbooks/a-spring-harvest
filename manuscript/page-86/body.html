<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Afterwards</h3><pre class="  ">Afterwards, when
The old Godsâ€™ hate
On the riven earth
No more is poured:
When weapons of war
Are all outworn
What shall become
Of the race of men?
One shall go forth
In the likeness of a child:
Under sere skies
Of a grey dawning:
One shall go forth
In the likeness of a child,
And desolate places
Shall spring and blossom:
