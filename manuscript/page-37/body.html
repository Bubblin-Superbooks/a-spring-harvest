    Even as very few men understand
    The glory of an ancient, storied land
In the wild current of the agesâ€™ flow,
Have not old scholars, centuries ago
    Caressed you in the hollow of their hand,
    The while with quiet, kindly eyes they scanned
Your pages, yellowed now, then white as snow?
A voice there is, cries through your every word,
Of him, that after greatest glory came
    Down the grey road to darkness and to tears;
A voice like far seas in still valleys heard,
Crying of love and death and hope and fame
    That change not with the changing of the years.</pre></div> </div>
