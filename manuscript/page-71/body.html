Not like to those who find untrodden ways;
    But down the weary paths we know,
Through every change of sky and change of days
    Silent, processional we go.
Not unto us the soft, unlaboured breath
    Of children’s hopes and children’s fears:
We are not sworn to battle to the death
    With all the wrongs of all the years:
We are old, we are old, and worn and school’d with ills,
    Maybe our road is almost done,
Maybe we are drawn near unto the hills
    Where rest is and the setting sun:
But yet a pride is ours that will not brook
    The taunts of fools too saucy grown,
He that is rash to prove it, let him look
