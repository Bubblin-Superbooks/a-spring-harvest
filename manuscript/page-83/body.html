<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The New Age And The Old</h3><pre class="  ">Like the small source of a smooth-flowing river,
    Like the pale dawn of a wonderful day,
Comes the New Age, from High God, the good giver,
    Comes with the shouts of the children at play:
As an old leaf whirls faster and faster
    From the sere branch that once gave it fair birth,
Into the arms of the devil, its master,
    Be the old age swept away from the earth!</pre></div> </div>
