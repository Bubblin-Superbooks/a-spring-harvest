<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Yet, while the empires turn to dust,
You shall live on, because you must.
O seven times happy he that dies
    After the splendid harvest-tide,
When strong barns shield from winter skies
    The grain that’s rightly stored inside:
There death shall scatter no more tears
Than o’er the falling of the years:
Aye, happy seven times is he
    Who enters not the silent doors
Before his time, but tenderly
    Death beckons unto him, because
There’s rest within for weary feet
Now all the journey is complete.</pre></div> </div>
