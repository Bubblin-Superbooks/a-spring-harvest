<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>The Last Meeting</h3><pre class="  ">We who are young, and have caught the splendour of
        life,
    Hunting it down the forested ways of the world,
Do we not wear our hearts like a banner unfurled
    (Crowned with a chaplet of love, shod with the sandals
        of strife)?
Now not a lustre of pain, nor an ocean of tears
    Nor pangs of death, nor any other thing
That the old tristful gods on our heads may bring
    Can rob us of this one hour in the midst of the years.</pre></div> </div>
